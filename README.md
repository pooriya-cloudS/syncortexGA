## üöÄ Project Overview

**SyncortexGA** is an advanced **Python package** implementing a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for generating **optimized university timetables**. Designed by **CortexSys**, this solution addresses complex scheduling challenges by considering multiple constraints such as:

- Instructor availability and preferences  
- Classroom capacities and equipment  
- Student schedule coherence and transit times  

It is engineered to be:

- **Modular & extensible** for easy integration with backend frameworks (Django, FastAPI)  
- **Asynchronous-ready** for scalable, non-blocking operations  
- **Configurable** to support custom constraints and scheduling policies
